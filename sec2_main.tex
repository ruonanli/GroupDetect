\section{Matching and Localizing Social Interactions}


Consider an input video consisting of $T$ temporal units, with each unit being a frame or several consecutive frames. By applying domain-appropriate detection and tracking, assume we obtain $M$ space-time tracks of bounding boxes enclosing $M$ faces or bodies. The $M$ targets are to be compared with an interaction exemplar consisting of $S$ temporal units and $N$ targets that are correctly detected and tracked and all participating in an coherent interaction. As the $M$ input tracks may include non-participants and false-positive tracks, it contains the same or more targets than the exemplar, \textit{i.e.}, $N\leq M$. Our representation for the input tracks therefore includes $M\times T$ $d_{I}$-dimensional descriptors $\{\mathbf{f}_{m,t}\}_{m=1,2,\cdots,M, t=1,2,\cdots,T}$, where $\mathbf{f}_{m,t}$ encodes the individual activity of the $m$th target at time $t$, and $M\times (M-1)\times T$ $d_{P}$-dimensional pairwise descriptors $\{\mathbf{g}_{m,m',t}\}_{m,m'=1,2,\cdots,M, m\neq m', t=1,2,\cdots,T}$, where $\mathbf{g}_{m,m',t}$ encodes dynamic visual properties of target $m$ exhibited relative to those of target $m'$ at time $t$. Loosely speaking, $\mathbf{g}_{m,m',t}$ describes the `influence' that target $m'$ exhibits over target $m$ at time $t$. The form of the descriptors is application dependent, and will be  discussed in experiment section. For each exemplar, we have two similar descriptor collections $\{\mathbf{f}^{D}_{n,s}\}_{n=1,2,\cdots,N, s=1, 2,\cdots, S}$ and $\{\mathbf{g}^{D}_{n,n',s}\}_{n,n'=1,2,\cdots,N, n\neq n', s=1, 2,\cdots, S}$. We denote the descriptor ensemble for the input at time $t$ to be $\mathcal{Q}_{t}\triangleq\{\mathbf{f}_{m,t},\mathbf{g}_{m,m',t}\}$, and that for the exemplar at time $s$ as $\mathcal{D}_{s}\triangleq\{\mathbf{f}^{D}_{n,s},\mathbf{g}^{D}_{n,n',s}\} $. The input is then represented as $\mathcal{Q}\triangleq\{\mathcal{Q}_{t}\}_{1\leq t\leq T}$ and the exemplar $\mathcal{D}\triangleq\{\mathcal{D}_{s}\}_{1\leq s\leq S}$.

Our tasks are 1) to identify from the $M$ targets in the input $N$ targets that demonstrate the most similar interactive pattern as the $N$ individuals in the exemplar, and 2) to temporally localize the extent of the interaction within the interval $[1, T]$. To formally describe task 1), consider the fact that if one of the $M$ targets is regarded as a participant in an interaction as exemplified by the exemplar $\mathcal{D}$, its behavior should properly match to the behavior of one of the $N$ individuals in the exemplar $\mathcal{D}$. Therefore, we use a $N\times M$ binary matrix $W=[w_{nm}]\in\{0,1\}^{N\times M}$ to formally represent the participant identification, where $w_{nm}=1$ means that the $n$th exemplar individual is matched to the $m$th input target and $w_{nm}=0$ means unmatched targets. For unambiguous matching, we expect each individual in the exemplar to find its unique partner target in the input. This implies that $\sum_{m}w_{nm}=1, \forall n$ and $\sum_{n}w_{nm}\leq 1, \forall m$, \textit{i.e.}, $W\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{1}^{T}W\leq\mathbf{1}^{T}$\footnote{Note that false-alarm tracks are already accounted for in the partial matching, and if we set the values of the descriptors of an out-of-scene target to be sufficiently large (or small) numbers, this target will not be matched with any target in the exemplar.}. Denote $\mathcal{W}\triangleq\{W\in\{0,1\}^{N\times M}| W\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{1}^{T}W\leq\mathbf{1}^{T}\}$, and our former task is essentially to find $W^{*}\in\mathcal{W}$, which encodes the best matching between the input $\mathcal{Q}$ and the exemplar $\mathcal{D}$. To formally describe task 2) is straightforward: We simply look for the starting time $T_{s}$ and ending time $T_{e}$, $1\le T_{s}<T_{e}\le T$, such that the interactive pattern of input $\mathcal{Q}$ during $[T_{s}, T_{e}]$ demonstrates the best similarity with the exemplar $\mathcal{D}$.

Our computational framework, as illustrated in Figure \ref{diagram}, has three steps. The first step is to evaluate $T\times S$ dis-similarity scores $D(\mathcal{Q}_{t}, \mathcal{D}_{s})$ together with their 'instantaneous optimal matching' $W^{t,s}$ between each time unit  $1\le t\le T$ and each time unit  $1\le s\le S$ (Section \ref{agg}). This is followed by a dual-accumulator Hough voting procedure to find the best matching $W^{*}$ (Section \ref{vote}). Finally, an efficient branch-and-bound search estimates the temporal extent $[T_{s}, T_{e}]$ (Section \ref{BB}).
